  The Palestinian territories are the two regions of the former British Mandate for
  Palestine that have been militarily occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of
  1967, namely: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The International Court of Justice
  has referred to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as "the Occupied Palestinian
  Territory", and this term was used as the legal definition by the ICJ in its advisory
  opinion of July 2004.
