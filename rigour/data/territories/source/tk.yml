  "Tokelau, known previously as the Union Islands, and, until 1976, known officially
  as the Tokelau Islands, is a dependent territory of New Zealand in the southern
  Pacific Ocean. It consists of three tropical coral atolls: Atafu, Nukunonu, and
  Fakaofo. In addition to these three, Swains Island, which forms part of the same
  archipelago, is the subject of an ongoing territorial dispute; it is currently administered
  by the United States as part of American Samoa."
